                        <p>Bets on football matches are accepted for the main time stipulated by the rules of the match
                            or tournament that includes the compensated time added by the match referee after the main
                            time of the half or the match. Events that took place during the time compensated by the
                            referee are considered to have occurred at the 45th or 90th minute. The football bets are
                            available for one team to win or draw or with handicap. Bets in Cup matches are also
                            available on whether one of the teams go to the next round, depends by the number of matches
                            played.<br>The line also offers bets on double results:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1X - home team team victory or draw; X2 - draw or away team victory;</li>
                            <li>12 - home or away team victory;</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Bets are accepted on handicaps and totals (total number of goals scored). The Player can
                            choose different values of handicaps (both positive and negative) and totals in the line. If
                            the Player bet on an integer "Total" and get into it, the bet is calculated with odds equal
                            to "1". Similarly, the Player can bet on the individual "Total" of the team. If the Player
                            get into the "Total", the bet is calculated with odds equal to "1".<br>The bet on " Who will
                            score more goals " offers a comparison of two teams from different matches when the team
                            that scores more goals will be recognized as the best. Bets are not accepted for "Combos"
                            and "Systems" with the proposed teams and are calculated with odds equal to "1" upon the
                            same performance from both teams. There are available bets on match listing:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Match Result" bet (the Player need to predict the final match score);</li>
                            <li>"Half time/ Full time Result" bet (the Player need to predict both the result of the
                                first half and the entire match). Initial letters are used in the line to indicate these
                                outcomes: V - victory, D - draw. The first place indicates the outcome of the first
                                half, and the second one indicates the match outcome. The outcome of the second half
                                does not matter for the calculation of this bet. For example, if the match finished 1:1,
                                and the first half 1:0 - the bet on the "V1D" outcome is winning; if the match finished
                                1:0, and the first half 0:0 - the bet on the "DV1" outcome is winning; if both the first
                                half and the match finished 1:0 - the bet on "V1V1" is winning;</li>
                            <li>"Goal in the First Half" bet means that Player can choose between "Yes/No" options to
                                predict whether a goal will be scored before the break;</li>
                            <li>The Player can bet on the time and player scoring the first goal, on the totals of the
                                first and/ or second half, etc.;</li>
                            <li>Bets on the statistics of a player in a match (goals, fouls, yellow cards and red cards,
                                etc.) are valid only if the Player is in the starting line-up. A goal for a Player is
                                considered only a ball scored in the opponent&rsquo;s net, own goals are not taken into
                                account;</li>
                            <li>Goals scored by replaced players are also taken into account for the "At Least One
                                Players Scores Two or More Goals" bet;</li>
                            <li>For the "Home/Away" game, the Player is asked to predict whether the difference between
                                the goals scored by the "Home" and "Away" teams will be more or less than the "handicap"
                                offered;</li>
                            <li>For the "round total" game, the Player is asked to predict whether the total number of
                                goals scored by the "Home" and "Away" teams together will be more or less than the
                                number offered by Crickto;</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Additionally, Players can bet on playing round:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Number of "Home" victories;</li>
                            <li>Number of "Away" victories;</li>
                            <li>Number of draws in the round;</li>
                            <li>Number of "Away" points, etc.;</li>
                            <li>"Home/ Away" and "round total" bets are not accepted in "Combos" with any other events
                                of the same tour. If one or more matches in the tour were interrupted and were not
                                completed within 12 hours, then bets for "Home/Away" and "round total" games are
                                calculated with odds equal to "1";</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Bets on "Corner Kicks, Yellow/Red Cards, Fouls, Shots on Target, Offsides, and Percentage of
                            Ball Possession, Substitutes" include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Corner kicks assigned, but not completed are not counted in the statistics. If the
                                referee does not count the corner kick but assigns it again, the corner kick will be
                                counted only once;</li>
                            <li>The second yellow card which will lead to the in the player's sending off, is considered
                                both a second yellow card and a red card. A player will be considered as sent-off if he
                                was in the field at the time of being sent off.). Cards shown to players on the bench or
                                to team personnel (coaching staff, managers, etc.) are not counted. Cards shown after
                                the end of the first half are considered as shown in the second half.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If two or more players from different teams get yellow or red cards based on a single game
                            episode - bets on the "Match First Yellow/Red Card" will be calculated with odds equal to
                            "1".</p>
                        <p>For the bet on "Time of the First or Last Goal" in a match, indicating the time intervals,
                            the Player needs to predict during which period the first or last goal in the match will be
                            scored. If the game finishes 0:0, the bet will be calculated with odds equal to "1".</p>
                        <p>In the " Who will score the next goal " market, there are three possible outcomes for the
                            Player: "Team 1", "Team 2" or "Zero Score".</p>
                        <p>For bets on "Most Productive Match", "Least Productive Match" or "Match with Most (Least)
                            Goals Scored", the Player needs to predict the match/matches from the selected list in which
                            the most or least goals will be scored. If the highest number of goals is scored in two or
                            more matches - bets on these matches are settled at the odds 1.</p>
                        <p>If one or more matches selected in the line were postponed for more than 36 hours from the
                            originally officially specified time, or were interrupted and not finished within 12 hours,
                            all bets on these games will be settled at the odds 1.</p>
                        <p>The bookmaker line accepts bets on the event that first occurs in a certain game period. The
                            Player need to predict what will happen during a certain time period: a goal scored, a
                            corner kick, a goal kick, an offside, a foul, an out, or none of these. Similarly, bets on
                            comparisons of the above events are available - the Players can bet which of the specified
                            events (for example, a goal or offside, a goal kick or corner kick) will occur earlier in a
                            certain period, or none of the above.</p>
                        <p>The following events are considered as occurred: a corner kick in the case of a kick executed
                            from a corner flag; a goal kick in the case of an actual goal kick; offside in the case of a
                            free kick performed upon recording the offside; out in the case of an actual throw-in; foul
                            in the case of a free or penalty kick performed upon recording a violation.</p>

                            sources, Crickto can settle bets based on statistical data from its own internal sources.
                        </p>
                        <p>Time accounting of each event to calculate the following: goal - the same time as the timer
                            at the moment of the ball crossing the goal line (scored goal); corner kick - time at the
                            moment of the kick from the corner mark; foul - time at the moment of the free or penalty
                            kick upon recording a violation of the rules; offside - time at the moment of the free kick
                            upon recording the offside; goal kick - time at the moment of the goal kick; out - the same
                            time as the timer at the moment of the out thrown. The bet is settled based on the match
                            timer for the TV broadcaster, which will be specified in the comments to a specific match on
                            the line. The parallel timer which is startled in parallel by Crickto is considered the main
                            timer for settling the bet when there is no time indicator in the TV broadcast. To determine
                            and make a final decision in disputed situations, Crickto can operate information from
                            internal sources about the match.</p>
                        <p>In the "First 5-Minute Match Prediction" the Player proposed to predict before the match
                            (pre- match bet) what event will take place first within the first five minutes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Goal scored;</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>The first five minutes of the match will be settled based on the period from 0:00 to 5:00
                            (from the Bets on first to the fifth minute inclusive) of the event. To consider a bet as a
                            winning, the goal shall be scored in the specified period (the goal kick and the ball
                            crossing the goal line shall be recorded in a certain period). If the kick was made in a
                            given period, and the goal was scored beyond such period, the bet will be considered as
                            lost. The corner kick shall be assigned within the specified time period and, if assigned,
                            will be counted. The penalty shall also be assigned within the specified time period.
                            Penalties will be ignored if the penalty event happened within the allotted time period, and
                            its appointment by referee outside of the period . If the penalty is awarded within the
                            specified period, and the attempt to execute it occurs later - the bet is still considered
                            won. Yellow or red cards will be counted at the moment when they will be shown by the
                            referee, but not at the moment of the foul commitment. If the reason for the yellow or red
                            card belongs to the specified period but the direct display of the card does not, the card
                            will not be counted. Only cards shown to the field players who participate in the match at
                            the time of card shown will be counted.</p>
                        <p>Appointed penalty is considered as the winning outcome if the penalty had been appointed
                            before the referee showed the card for a foul.</p>
                        <p>It is proposed to the Player to specify the outcome of the match based on the European
                            handicap. In case of a bet with a European handicap, the Player needs to predict the outcome
                            of the match with the condition that the match begins from a certain score, specified in the
                            value of the handicap. The final score for such bets is calculated by adding the game result
                            and the handicap value. The following outcomes are possible when betting with the European
                            handicap:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Home win with handicap;</li>
                            <li>Away win with handicap;</li>
                            <li>Draw with handicap;</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The European handicap does not imply a partial or full refund of the bet: the Player can
                            either win or lose the bet in full.</p>
                        <p>Example 1. Handicap (0-1) means a bet assuming that after the end of the game, 0 is added to
                            the goals scored by the home team, and 1 is added to the goals scored by the away team. The
                            "home win with handicap" outcome will be a win if the match ends with the home team winning
                            by 2 or more goals, for example, 2:0 or 3:1 (2:1 or 3:2 with 0-1 handicap), etc. The "draw
                            with handicap" outcome will only be a win if the home team wins exactly 1 goal, for example,
                            1-0 or 2:1 (1:1 or 2:2 with the selected handicap 0-1), etc. The "away win with handicap"
                            outcome will be a win if the away team ends the match with a draw or win, for example, 0:0
                            or 0:1 (0:1 or 0: 2 with the selected handicap 0-1).</p>
                        <p>Example 2. Handicap (1-0) means a bet assuming that after the end of the game, 1 is added to
                            the goals scored by the home team, and 0 is added to the goals scored by the away team. The
                            prediction for the "home win with handicap" outcome will play for any home win or draw, for
                            example, 1:0 or 1:1 (2:0 or 2:1 with the selected handicap 1-0), etc. The bet on the "draw
                            with handicap" outcome will only take place if the away team wins by a single goal
                            difference, for example, 0:1 or 1:2 (1:1 or 2:2 with the selected handicap 1-0), etc. The
                            "away win with handicap" outcome will only be won if the away team triumphs with a
                            difference of two or more goals in 2 or more goals, for example, 0:2 or 1:3 (1:2 or 2:3 with
                            the selected handicap 1-0), etc.</p>
                        <p>The "Shots on the goal/crossbar kick" market: when settled this bet, one takes into account
                            shots at the goal post or crossbar, after which the ball remained in play (flying out into
                            the pitch or touching the referee, or a player of one of the teams, or another post or
                            crossbar after a rebound).</p>
                        <p>The ball hitting the post or crossbar is not considered in the following cases:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The goal was scored (the ball flew into the net);</li>
                            <li>The game was stopped before the ball hit the post or crossbar;</li>
                            <li>After hitting the crossbar, the ball crossed the goal line without touching the pitch;
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Bet on "goalless time periods" assumes that if "n" goals are scored during a match, then the
                            minutes, when goals have been scored, divide a time period of a match (from 0 to 90 minutes)
                            into "n+1" goalless time periods. The duration of goalless time periods is calculated as the
                            difference between:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Minutes of the first goal and match start;</li>
                            <li>Minutes of successive goals;</li>
                            <li>Minutes of the match end and the last goal;</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The match starts at 0 minute. Goals scored in the time compensated by the referee for the
                            first and second half are considered goals scored at the 45th and 90th minutes respectively.
                            If there have not been scored any goals, thus, it is considered that there has been one
                            90-minute goalless period.</p>
                        <p>Example 1. If a match has been completed within the main time with 0:0 score, thus, it is
                            considered that there has been only one 90-minute goalless period.</p>
                        <p>Example 2. If there have been scored 2 goals in a match: at 23rd and 62nd minutes, then there
                            have been only 3 goalless periods: 23 minutes (23-0), 39 minutes (62-23), and 28 minutes
                            (90- 62).</p>
                        <p>Example 3. If there have been scored 3 goals in a match: at the 15th, 45th, and 90th minutes,
                            then there have been only 4 goalless periods: 15 minutes (15-0), 30 minutes (45-15), 45
                            minutes (90-45), and a 0- minute period (90-90).</p>

                        <p>Crickto accepts bets on basketball matches taking into account overtimes (OT), if the
                            scheduled game time ends with a draw. In addition to individual bets on a draw or a clean
                            victory of one of the teams (1, X, 2), bets on such outcomes are accepted for the scheduled
                            game time. In basketball matches, determining the winner of the confrontation provided for
                            two games (home and away games), the match can end in a draw without overtime.</p>
                        <p>Example 1: play-off match (according to the regulations, a winner is determined based on the
                            sum of two matches), the first match ends with a score of 85-80, the second match ends with
                            a score of 75-75 (without overtime). In the second match, the rules do NOT provide for
                            overtime, since the score of two matches is 160:155, which guarantees the first team to get
                            to the next round.</p>
                        <p>Example 2: play-off match (according to the regulations, a winner is determined based on the
                            sum of two matches), the first match ends with a score of 78-72 in favor of team 1, the
                            second match ends with a score of 87-81 in favor of team 2. Since the sum of two matches is
                            159:159, overtime in the second match is appointed to determine a team to pass to the next
                            round (this overtime is only considered when betting on the "Qualifying to the next round)"
                            market).</p>
                        <p>When betting on a combined total or individual total, Crickto offers the Players to predict
                            the total number of the points in a match scored by teams combined or the score of one
                            individual team.</p>
                        <p>In some specific matches, bets are available for each quarter of the match. For example, the
                            Player must predict the most/least productive quarter of the match.</p>
                        <p>Bets on number of points, rebounds scored by the players of either team according to the line
                            are also available. The bet will be refunded if one of the basketball players does not
                            appear on the pitch.</p>
                        <p>In the "Duel of players" betting market, Crickto offers the Player to predict who will score
                            more points, make more assists or collect more rebounds. Such bets are settled based on the
                            official match protocol (including overtime, if the scheduled game time ends in a draw). The
                            bet will be refunded if one of the basketball players does not appear on the pitch.</p>
                        <p>Bets on general "Performance" for basketball players take into account the total sum of
                            points, assists and rebounds of a particular athlete. Blocked shots and steals are not
                            counted as Performance points. Bets are settled according to the official match protocol
                            (considering overtime). The bet will be refunded if one of the basketball players does not
                            appear on the pitch.</p>

                        <p>Crickto accepts bets on baseball within the approved betting line, but there are a number of
                            features when calculating bets. For a bet to be considered valid, the minimum duration of a
                            baseball game shall be at least five innings, except when the home team leads after four and
                            a half innings. If a match is interrupted or postponed for any reason, the game winner is
                            determined according to the result after the last full inning, except cases when the home
                            team evens the score or takes the first lead in the second half of the period. Then the
                            winner is determined with a result at the match interruption. If the game is interrupted
                            after the home team has evened the score, bets on the game are calculated with odds equal to
                            "1". Bets on the outcome of the first five innings of a match are settled based on the
                            result of the game result after the full five innings. In case of a draw, bets on the
                            victory of one of the teams are calculated with odds equal to "1". To consider a bet on
                            totals and handicaps in a match as valid, at least nine innings need to be played or, if the
                            home team leads in the score, eight and a half. If a match is postponed or interrupted for
                            any reason in extra innings, the match result is determined after the last full inning,
                            except cases when the home team evens the score or takes the first lead in the second half
                            of the period. Then the winner is determined at the time of the match interruption. If from
                            5.5 to 8 innings have been played, the values of a handicap and totals, which have not been
                            specified to the moment of interruption, are settled with odds equal to "1". Bets on the
                            "home/away" market on the number of wins of the home and/or away team are also calculated.
                            The rest of the outcomes are settled with odds equal to "1". In the "home/away" baseball
                            market, the game-day matches are counted with the number of matches indicated. And in the
                            "Most/Least Productive Match" market, bets are settled based on the highest/lowest game
                            score in any of the specified matches. The "Number of Shutout Matches" bet is settled based
                            on the number of teams that have gained no points in a given game day. If two matches have
                            been played on the same game day, and Crickto recorded only one, the result is counted for
                            the first among them.</p>
                        <p>The "Number of Extra Innings " bet is settled in accordance with a total number of additional
                            innings played in all matches.</p>
                        <p>If the pitcher was substituted in the match, this event does not affect the match outcome.
                        </p>
                        <p>If the match has not taken place for some reason within the scheduled time and/or has been
                            postponed for more than twelve hours from the time indicated in the betslip, all bets are
                            settled with odds equal to "1".</p>
                        <p>If the match has not been finished due to bad weather conditions or other reasons, bets on
                            the match winner are settled based on the result at the time of the game interruption,
                            assuming that this result is approved by the tournament organizers as final. Otherwise, all

                                points), disqualification or failure, other;</li>
                            <li>The bet on the ahead-of-time win by winning by knockout or technical knockout, by
                                submission or surrender of an opponent, disqualification or failure, other.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The bet on the fight duration means that the Players need to predict the number of rounds.
                            The period of two minutes and thirty seconds is taken as the half of a five-minute round
                            (hence a round and a half is a round plus two minutes and thirty seconds of the second
                            round). If the fight is considered completed exactly in the middle of the round, the Players
                            are refunded the "more/less" bet on the total number of rounds held. The bet on winning a
                            round means that the last round held is considered a win if on of the participating fighters
                            refuses to continue the fight in the break between rounds, or fails to enter the fight after
                            the beginning of the next round.</p>
                        <p>If the number of rounds in a match changes, bets on the fight outcome and the method of
                            achieving it remain relevant. Bets on the number of rounds will be refunded.</p>
                        <p>If the referees at MMA tournaments cannot determine the winner of the fight by setting a
                            draw, bets on the fight victory are settled with odds equal to "1". All other bets are
                            settled based on the actual fight outcome.</p>
